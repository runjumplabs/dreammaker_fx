### Some C++ basics

C++ is a programming language that has been around for several decades.  While it has a lot of advanced capabilities, one only needs to learn a few basics to starting creating some amazing sounds.

#### 1. Adding comments to your code
It's always good to leave some comments for yourself when writing code so you can remind yourself of how things work down the road.  There are two types of comments in C++: single line comments and multi-line comments.

```
// This is a comment on a single line
```
```
/*
This is a comment that...
... takes up multiple lines
*/
```

##### 2. Declaring functions
A function is basically set of instructions that we
```
void my_function() {


}
```
